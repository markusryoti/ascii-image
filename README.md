# Ascii art

This is a project for converting images to ascii character representations of those images. Currently not working that well.

# Usage

Image is converted to HTML file `ascii.html` which displays the ascii image.

Run with:

`python ascii.py <path-to-img>`

# Testing framework

The tests are written using Robot Framework. You probably need to edit the `run_tests.sh` script if you want to run tests.
